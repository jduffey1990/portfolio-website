My portfolio website

I started my working life as a dentist. After 4 years in private practice, I decided that being in health care wasn't my true calling. I decided that I wanted my career to fit my skills better, and to curate my career around my life, not the other way around. I now am pursuing a career in software development in Denver, CO.
